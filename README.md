# Things in Rings Fan Project

![Things in Rings Fan Website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ender-Wiggin2019/Things-In-Rings/refs/heads/main/src/app/opengraph-image.jpg)

This project aims to bring multi-language and more replayability to this wonderful game.
Main features are:

1. Multi-language Rule Cards (currently only en and zh-CN, but can have more languages with translation file)
2. Fan-made Rule Cards. With more rule cards, more replayability and more fun!
3. Rule set generator. Currently only support simply random generation, but in future I will add more options for generation.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## Help to Translate

If you want to provide an additional translation, you can go to the [locales](https://github.com/Ender-Wiggin2019/Things-In-Rings/tree/main/public/locales) folder and follow these steps:

1. Copy the `public/locales/en.json`, and paste them in a new folder with the name of your language (e.g. `fr` for French).
2. You can send a pull request with the new files, or send them to me by email (see my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Ender-Wiggin2019).)
